Debut album by the two brothers with Ecuadorian roots. The record comes with 8 songs. Smooth guitars and some gentle rhythm effects looped in it. If you like Latin, Soul / Funk this might be something for you. The title refers to the age difference of the two. The perfect album for this summer (or any holiday under the sun).
