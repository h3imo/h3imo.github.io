# WebEngineering Module, Graded Exercise

## Commit Proposal

Matrikel Number: 02-906-048

Project idea short description:

I want to display my record collection. The idea is to create a webapplication to add records that I have but more importantly also a wantlist. Those should be displayed in a nice way.

Optionally I want to play around with the discogs API https://www.discogs.com/developers/

I am not sure if the timeframe is sufficient to implement features via API as well. But it’s my aim - maybe not within this project - but maybe later.


## Project confirmation

Confirmed, D. König.

This is a cool idea.
You best start small to have a running application early on.
Then extend to the more advanced features. Discogs looks like a feasible service to include.

Have fun!

## Project description:      (if other than `/index.html`)

I built a Jekyll site. First I wanted to build a web application for my record collection. But I soon realized that I wanted to use this opportunity to build a personal website.

I did use a starting template that includes Jekyll, GulpJS, SASS, AutoPrefixer &amp; BrowserSync (see link 2) which I found via the awesome tutorial I followed to start getting used with Jekyll (see link 1). Also see the README.md file in the root directory of the folder.

### Other comments:

I'm particular proud of: I could dig into Jekyll which I find an extremely nice technology to build fast and modern websites. I struggled to get into collections and design the content type outputs for the records. That's why I only built a rather slim site with only two pages.

I really learnt stuff about liquid templating as well as the jade templates. But also how to work with SASS and especially flexbox. Since the tutorial and the other things I did use do not rely on Bootstrap or an other framework.

Also I am proud on the design that I developed. As this will be the perfect start for my personal website. I plan to add travel recommendations and a blog to also write regularly about differnt topics of interest.

Nevertheless I am a bit underwhelmed that I lost so much time searching for errors due to collections and displaying the content type (single record view)

### To dos:
- properly design single view of records
- add and design further pages
- add more functionality to the record listings page (search, filter, etc)
- add a newsletter tool and
- add javascript to add some effects
- build a deployment pipeline with tests
- publish it on github pages
- integration of Discogs API
